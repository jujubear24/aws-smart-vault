    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    # Steps represent a sequence of tasks that will be executed as part of the job
    steps:
      # Step 1: Checks out your repository under $GITHUB_WORKSPACE, so your job can access it.
      - name: Check out repository code

        run: |
          python -m pip install --upgrade pip
          pip install -r src/tests/requirements.txt

      # Step 4: Runs the unit tests using Python's unittest module.
      # If any test fails, this step will fail, and the entire workflow run will be marked as failed.
